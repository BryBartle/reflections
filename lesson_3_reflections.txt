When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Whenever you wish to have other people view your work or you are 
    collaborating with someone else on a project and need to be able to 
    easily share and update your branch(es).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you may not want all the changes that are on GitHub at that 
	point in or you may not be ready to push your most recent versions 
	and commits up to GitHub and make them public. Your code may not be 
	ready for the public yet or you may decide that you don't want to 
	show your most recent versions to the public at all.
